	<h2>The Life Cycle of a Star</h2>
	
	<div id = "accordion">
	
		<h3>What Are Stars?</h3>
		<div id = "general">
			<img src = "sun.jpg" alt = "Sun">
			
			<p>Stars are giant balls of ionized gas, or plasma, that convert hydrogen
			into helium through nuclear fusion at millions of degrees. They are in 
			constant balance between their intense gravity, which holds them together, 
			and the energy released from fusion, which tries to force them apart. The 
			hottest stars appear blue; relatively cooler stars appear orange or red. 
			Stars can be many thousands of times larger than our Sun, and can have 
			surface temperatures ranging from 4,000K (Kelvin) to 50,000K (roughly the 
			same in degrees Celsius), as well as a core temperature of 10 to 15 million K.</p>
			
			<section><small><i>Image:</i> The Sun is a comparatively 
			small star, but perfect for life on Earth.</small></section>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Birth of a Star</h3>
		<div id = "birth">
			<img src = "rosette_nebula.jpg" alt = "Nebula">
				
			<p>Stars are "born" in <dfn>nebulae</dfn>, clouds of hydrogen gas and dust in space. 
			As the gas condenses it exerts a greater gravitational force on other debris. As 
			more debris and gas collapse inward, their collisions begin to generate
			heat and light, and they become protostars. If enough matter is collected, and 
			if temperatures approach 10 million K, hydrogen atoms will begin to fuse into 
			helium. At this point, huge amounts of energy are released, the gas stops 
			collapsing inward, and the now-equalized <dfn>Main Sequence</dfn> star begins 
			to shine.</p>
			
			<section><small><i>Image:</i> The Rosette Nebula. The bright stars in the 
			center are very young, at only a few million years old.</small></section>
		</div>
			
		<h3>Star Life</h3>
		<div id = "life">
			<img src = "star_size.jpg" alt = "Star Comparison">
			
			<p>A Main Sequence star the size of our Sun will burn consistently for about 
			10 billion years. Larger stars may only last a few billion or even only a few
			million years. As it runs out of hydrogen, the core of the star will contract 
			and its outer shell will expand and cool. The star has become a <dfn>red 
			giant</dfn> (or in some cases a hotter, larger <dfn>blue giant</dfn>), and may 
			remain so for a few million years, fusing helium into carbon. To put it in 
			perspective, when the Sun reaches this stage, it will completely envelop 
			Mercury and Venus!</p>

			<section><small><i>Image:</i> Our sun has a few billion years of fuel left before it
			becomes a red giant, like Arcturus.</small></section>			
		</div>
		
		<h3>Death</h3>
		<div id = "death">
			<img src = "cat_eye_nebula.jpg" alt = "Cat's Eye Nebula">
			
			<p>When a star the mass of our Sun reaches the end of its red giant stage,
			it will completely lose its balance and shed most of its mass in a 
			<dfn>nova</dfn>. Its hydrogen and helium is thrown outward; this gas forms a 
			<dfn>planetary nebula</dfn> from which new stars can be formed. The remainder
			of the star, its core and a thin layer of the outer shell, will still shine 
			for many years and is called a <dfn>white dwarf</dfn>. When white dwarfs 
			expend the rest of their fuel, they finally "die," stop glowing, and become 
			<dfn>black dwarfs</dfn>.</p>
			
			<section><small><i>Image:</i> The Cat's Eye planetary nebula. <br>
			The center of the "eye" is the creator of the nebula, now a white 
			dwarf.</small></section>
			
			<img src = "supernova.jpg" alt = "Supernova">
			
			<p id = "death2">If a star has a mass many times larger than that of the Sun, the end of 
			its life may be much more spectacular. Massive stars can grow well past 
			red giant size until they become <dfn>red supergiants</dfn>, with temperatures
			at their cores approaching 600 million K! Heavier and heavier elements are 
			fused together in the core at this temperature until the core is mostly iron;
			at this point, gravity finally wins, pulling the outer shell of gas in and 
			ricocheting it out in a massive explosion called a <dfn>supernova</dfn>. <br>The
			old core of the star may remain as a neutron star, or may collapse in on 
			itself to form a black hole - learn more about them on the next page!</p>
