	<h2>What's Left After Big Stars Burn Out?</h2>
	
	<div id = "accordion">
	
		<h3>Neutron Stars</h3>
		<div id = "nstar">
			<img src = "neutron_star.jpg" alt = "Neutron Star">
		
			<p>After a star 4 to 8 times larger than the Sun expends the rest of its fuel 
			and goes through a supernova, the core that is left behind is a <dfn>neutron 
			star</dfn>.  Atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, normally have 
			a nucleus of positively charged protons, with negatively-charged electrons 
			orbiting that nucleus and a lot of empty space in between the two.  Within a 
			neutron star, however, the gravitational pull is so strong that it crushes atoms, 
			eliminating all the empty space between nuclei.  Protons and electrons are 
			forced together, equalizing each other and forming neutrons.  Because of this, 
			neutron stars tend to only be about the size of a city, but are so dense that 
			a teaspoon's worth of their matter weighs millions of tons.  They radiate intense
			energy via X-rays, and have surface temperatures of over 1 million K.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Pulsars</h3>
		<div id = "pulsar">
			<img src = "pulsar.jpg" alt = "Pulsar">
			
			<p>Sometimes a neutron star will have so much energy left to expel that it is
			reclassified as a <dfn>pulsar</dfn>.  Pulsars spin at several hundred revolutions 
			per second, and emit huge bursts of gamma rays and X-rays at their poles. 
			Scientists observe them by their "pulses" - the rays emitted when their poles 
			are pointing at Earth - and are still learning why they emit rays in this way.</p>

			rays.</small></section>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Black Holes</h3>
		<div id = "black_hole">
			<img src = "black_hole.jpg" alt = "Black Hole">
		
			<p>If a star is 10 times larger than the Sun or greater, it may become a neutron
			star at the end of its life, but will likely become so dense that it will completely
			collapse inward on itself to form a <dfn>black hole</dfn>. Black holes are incredibly
			dense, at least a few times as dense as the Sun, and have such powerful gravity 
			that even light cannot escape them.  They consume all matter around them and continue
			to grow.  Some black holes are <dfn>supermassive</dfn>, with billions of times the 
			mass of the Sun.  It is theorized that supermassive black holes reside at the
			heart of most galaxies, but scientists are not sure how these giants become so large.</p>
			
			<section><small><i>Image:</i> Artist's conception of a black hole absorbing matter.
			Black holes are so dense they distort the space around them.</small></section>
			
			<p>Black holes have two major parts: an event horizon and a singularity. The 
			<dfn>event horizon</dfn> around a black hole is the radius at which light 
			cannot escape it.  The singularity is its central point, where its mass is 
			concentrated.</p>
