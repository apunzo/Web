	<div id = "accordion">
	
		<h3>The Trip to Mars</h3>
		<div id = "mars">
			<img src = "rover_1.jpg" alt = "Rover Shot on Mars">
		
			<p>The the trip to mars was a costly one but we mostly got our funding from company backers
			and by using online crowd-funding websites.  With our rover being comparable to
			NASA's Curiosity expedition rover which is the size of a small SUV then it is expected that
			this is going to be a pricey journey.  This expedition took months of planning and calculations
			to make sure everything was exact and perfect.  We needed to be flawless in order for this to
			be a success and in order for us to be able to get funding for future expeditions.  If this is 
			seen as a failure then there goes our expedition program.  Alas, everything went as planned and
			our rover (appropriately named Ares) got some great shots for us when it reached Mars.

		<h3>Rover Specs</h3>
		<div id = "specs">
			<img src = "rover_specs.jpg" alt = "Anatomy of a Rover">
			
			<p>As you can see these space exploration rovers are a little more than complicated.  They are very
			intricate machines and take months to years to make.  Ours took a little over a year to complete and
			get ready for its first trip, to Mars.  Every rover has a body that houses all of its vital organs
			including its brain and energy source.  The brain is nothing more than computer processors while the 
			energy component is a battery.  We also had temperature controls installed and a layer of insulation.
			To make the rover have a humans perspective a neck and head were installed with a camera attached at 
			the top for a human-esque view.  The rover is also outfitted with arms and small clamps for hands. 
			Wheels are its source of mobility.  Lastly it has antennas for its much needed communication aspect.

		<h3>Future Projects</h3>
		<div id = "future">
			<img src = "neptune.jpg" alt = "Neptune">
		
			<p>Our current project is building an underwater rover to send to Neptune.  We are currently in the
			beginning parts of planning but everything looks like its going well.  Looking for new backers is tough
			but we a slowly getting to our goal.  We should reach it within a few more months.  Backers on our website
			who contribute will be able to come to our facilities and see first hand what the rover brings back from
			the watery giant.  Find us on Kickstarter.
